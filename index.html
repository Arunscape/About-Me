								<span class="image main"><img src="images/img.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>	I am a second year Computer Engineering Co-op student at the University of Alberta.
									I have experience coding in C++ and Python for University projects, as well as for personal projects,
									I also have some experience with Javascript and Java. By April 2018, I will have completed introductory courses containing the following topics:
									<a href="https://github.com/Arunscape/Arduino-Stuff/tree/master/2017%20assignments"> Arduino Programming in C++ </a>, algorithms in Python, discrete mathematics, formal systems logic, digital systems logic,electric circuits,
									microprocessor architecture,and continuous time signals and systems.
									You can see stuff I've made <a href="#work">here</a>.</p>

								<p>During the free time that I may have, I enjoy watching nerdy Youtube videos such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Jayztwocents">JayzTwoCents</a> and
								   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile/">Computerphile</a>, or coding in a freestyle sort of way. Sometimes, this results in useful tools, such as
							       this <a href="https://github.com/Arunscape/File_sorter"> file sorter </a> I made, which sorts my Downloads folder for me! </p>

								 <p>In high school, I volunteered for an Audio/Video club, which i put over 200 hours into. The purpose of this club was to magage the technology side
								    of school events such as fundraisers, talent shows, or dances. From this, I have gained experience in organizing events, liasing with other teams,
								    leading teams (while directing cameramen), and training new members. </p>

								<p>An overview of stuff I've been doing:</p>

								<h3 class="major">HackED Beta 2017</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/hackathon.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This was my first hackathon, hosted by the <a href="http://www.compeclub.com/">University of Alberta Computer Engineering Club</a>, which was a really fun and rewarding experience. It was my first time working in a group larger
								   than 2 people for a coding project, and also the first time working with Javascript for most of our team. We actually spent
							       the first 5 hours of the hackathon on Codecademy, just learning Javascript. After 24 hours, we were surprised to find out that
							       we actually won "Best Web Application"!</p>
								<p>The "webapp" we created, named <a href="https://arunscape.github.io/Gallery-In-Three.js-HackED-Beta-2017/">Gallery in Three.js</a>
								   was made entirely in Javascript, and a library called <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>
								   This library allows for relatively easy creation of 3-D projects inside a browser. We decided to make a 3-D gallery of sorts, which
								   displays pictures on the walls in a hallway that you can "walk" down, except that these pictures are GIFs that are loaded from <a href="https://gfycat.com/">Gfycat</a>.
								   For "Acid mode", the GIFs are actually loaded using Gfycat's API, which allowed us to randomly pick from the top 100 trending GIFs, so there will be different GIFs
								   displayed every time! The other two modes use direct links to GIFs we chose, because the random GIFs in "Acid Mode" was a proof of concept, but we also wanted to be
								   able to showcase different modes, such as "Scary Mode" where the hallway is dark, creepy GIFs are displayed, lights are flashing and the user randomly teleports to provide a somewhat
								   "scary" experience. The code is available <a href="https://github.com/Arunscape/Gallery-In-Three.js-HackED-Beta-2017">here</a>.
							    </p>

								<h3 class="major">CMPUT 274</h3>
								<h5> From the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/undergraduate-studies/course-directory/courses/introduction-to-tangible-computing-i">UAlberta course archive:</a> </h5>
								<font size="3">"CMPUT 274/275 is an experimental 2-course pilot introduction to computer science. It integrates the introductory computing courses (CMPUT 174/175) with the second-year introductory algorithms course (CMPUT 204) and the second year introductory systems course (CMPUT 201).
								<br>
								The course uses a problem-based approach to motivate the concepts and illustrate their application. It will be using the Arduino concrete-computing platform so that students will both become familiar with the typical screen-keyboard-mouse style of computing, but also the kind of embedded computing that is behind the scenes in the many devices that surround us. Delivery is hands on, with the classes taking place in the lab environment."</font>
								<p></p>

								<h4>Final Project: <a href="https://github.com/bojotamara/arduino-chess-game">Arduino Chess Game</a></h4>
								<p>For our final project, we decided to make a player versus player implementation
									of chess on a single Arduino mega board. It includes all the basic rules
									for chess that you may know. A graphical representation of the board is displayed on the Arduino
									with a side menu with contextual tips, that displays useful information such as
									whose turn it is, if the move you're attempting is invalid, if someone is in
									check, among other things. There are two joysticks, one for each player.
									On your turn, you can use your joystick to select pieces and then move them.
									The program only allows you to make valid moves according to the rules of chess,
									and also includes the special moves: castling, en passant, and promotion.
									The program automatically detects check and checkmate, and for the latter,
									ends the game and declares the winner.</p>

								<h4>Assignment 2: <a href="https://github.com/Arunscape/Arduino-Stuff/tree/master/2017%20assignments/Assignment%202%20restaurant%20finder/part_2">Restaurant Finder</a></h4>
								<p>Allows a user to
									browse a map of Edmonton using a joystick and a display on an Arduino, and find
									restaurants nearby where the user clicks the joystick. The user can select a rating from 1 to 5, which allows the user to filter out
									restaurants that have a lower rating. Additionally, the user can scroll through
									multiple screens in the restaurant selection menu, so now the user can choose
									from all of the restaurants that match the rating criteria the user selects.</p>

								<h4>Assignment 1: <a href="https://github.com/Arunscape/Arduino-Stuff/tree/master/2017%20assignments/Assignment%201%20chat%20program/Part_2_32_bit_keys_and_rolling_cipher">Arduino Encrypted Chat</a></h4>
								<p>This program allows serial communication between Arduinos. The characters are
									encrypted using XOR encryption. Two private keys are generated using the least
									significant bit from 32 readings from the analogPin. From this, public keys are
									generated and exchanged automatically, allowing a shared key to be used for the
									encryption. For added security, the program makes use of a rolling cipher.
									Initially, both Arduinos start with the same shared key. The arduinos use two
									streams for the encryption, and both these streams also start with the same
									key, which is initially the shared key. From there, When one Arduino sends any
									character , that Arduino uses its encrypt_key to send and encrypted character to
									the other Arduino. This other arduino will use its decrypt_key to decrypt the
									character. Whenever one person types a new character, the encrypt_key is
									discarded and a new one is generated. Similarly, whenever one person receives
									a new character, the decrypt_key is discarded once used, and a new one is
									generated.</p>

								<font size="2">Note: All the above "bigger" assignments, and the final project were done in groups of 2. The exercises were done individually.</font>
								<p></p>
								<h4><a href="https://github.com/Arunscape/Arduino-Stuff/tree/master/2017%20assignments">Exercises</a></h4>
								<font size="3">Exercises included the following topics:
									<br>
								</font>
									<ol>
									  <li>Sending an SOS signal by blinking an LED on the Arduino</li>
									  <li>5-bit binary counter using LEDs</li>
									  <li>IPv4 Octets</li>
									  <li>String processing (print backwards and custom strlen() )</li>
									  <li>Moving a cursor on a map on a display connected to an Arduino</li>
									  <li>Accessing data on an SD card and memory pointers on an Arduino</li>
									  <li>Recursively finding a greatest common denominator using Euclid's Algorithm</li>
									  <li>Pointer based abstract data structures</li>
									</ol>

								<h3 class="major">Personal Project: File Sorter</h3>
								<p>One day, I was sick of manually organizing my neglected Downloads folder, which over time
									had become very messy. So, I sat down, and created a script using Python to organize the files
									in my downloads folder for me! The script loops over an easy to edit csv file, where one column
									contains the file extension to be sorted, and the next column dictates where that file should be moved to.
									The code is available <a href="https://github.com/Arunscape/File_sorter">here</a>.</p>

								<h3 class="major">For fun: Flappy Bird Fork</h3>
								<p>On a boring day in High School, I found a repo where a guy made a Flappy Bird clone using Python, because
									that was the hot new trend around that time. Right around then I was intrigued by GUI Programming
									in Python, so I decided to learn some Tkinter. I added a "login" form, which allows a user to "login" and
									play the game, and afterwards it would save the person's high score, and compare you against other players.
									The "passwords" are simply stored in a csv  file, but this was not meant to be a serious thing anyways. The code
									is <a href="https://github.com/Arunscape/FlapPyBird">here</a>.</p>
